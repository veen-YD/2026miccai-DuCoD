## Abstract

Accurate classification of gastrointestinal lesions from endoscopic images is critical for early cancer detection and clinical decision making. In routine practice, white-light imaging (WLI) is widely available, while narrow-band imaging (NBI) provides enhanced mucosal and vascular contrast with stronger diagnostic cues. However, paired NBI-WLI data are scarce, which limits the development of effective cross-modal learning approaches. This paper proposes a dual-scale concept-guided distillation framework for unpaired cross-modal endoscopic classification. The method leverages NBI during training to transfer diagnostic knowledge to WLI for reliable WLI-only inference. Our framework uses dual-scale semantic concepts and distillation strategies at both sample and class levels to preserve local decision behavior and global class structure. Experimental results on an esophageal endoscopy dataset show significant improvement over baseline methods.
